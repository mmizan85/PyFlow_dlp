# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the extension icons in PNG format:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Creating Icons

You can create icons using:

1. **Online Tools**:
   - Canva (https://www.canva.com)
   - Figma (https://www.figma.com)
   - Adobe Express (https://www.adobe.com/express)

2. **Desktop Software**:
   - Adobe Photoshop
   - GIMP (free)
   - Inkscape (free, vector-based)

3. **AI Tools**:
   - Use an AI image generator with the prompt:
     "Modern minimalist icon for YouTube downloader app, gradient cyan to blue, dark background, clean design, 128x128"

## Design Guidelines

### Color Scheme
- Primary: Cyan (#06b6d4) to Blue (#3b82f6) gradient
- Background: Dark (#0f0f0f or transparent)
- Style: Modern, minimalist, glassmorphism

### Icon Elements
Consider including:
- Download arrow (↓)
- Play button (YouTube reference)
- Video/media symbol
- Abstract modern shapes

### Export Settings
- Format: PNG with transparency
- Sizes: Exactly 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 pixels
- Color depth: 24-bit or 32-bit (with alpha channel)

## Temporary Solution

If you don't have icons ready, the extension will still work but will show:
- Chrome's default extension icon (puzzle piece)
- Or a placeholder icon

To add icons later:
1. Create the three PNG files
2. Place them in this directory
3. Reload the extension in Chrome

## Quick Icon Creation Steps

### Using Favicon Generators

1. Create a simple design in any tool (even MS Paint)
2. Use a favicon generator like https://favicon.io/
3. Upload your design
4. Download the generated icons
5. Rename to icon16.png, icon48.png, icon128.png

### Using Image Resizing Tools

1. Create one large icon (256x256 or 512x512)
2. Use an online resizer like https://www.iloveimg.com/resize-image
3. Create three versions at exact sizes
4. Save as PNG with transparency

## Example Icon Prompts (for AI)

If using DALL-E, Midjourney, or Stable Diffusion:

```
Modern minimalist logo for YouTube video downloader, 
cyan and blue gradient, download arrow icon, 
dark background, clean professional design, 
square icon format, flat design style
```

```
Abstract modern icon featuring download symbol, 
gradient from cyan to blue, glassmorphism effect,
dark theme, minimalist, 128x128 pixels
```

Note: The extension will function perfectly without custom icons, 
but adding them improves the professional appearance.
